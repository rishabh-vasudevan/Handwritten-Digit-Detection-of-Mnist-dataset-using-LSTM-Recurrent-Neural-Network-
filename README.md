# Handwritten-Digit-Detection-of-Mnist-dataset-using-LSTM-Recurrent-Neural-Network
This was a test to check if Rnn network will be able to find a sequence in the mnist dataset.

The mnist dataset contains 60000 images of 28x28 pixel images.
what I did was make a LSTM with 28 time steps and 28 features per time set. So basically using the alredy existing mnist shape.

The result was way better than what i expected with an accuracy of 99.99% on train set and an accuracy of 99.22% on the test set.
